My collection of solutions of some problems found at ACM UVA Online Judged. These solutions were written in C/C++, during the year between 2002 and 2007. 

Few points to note:

a) Code was mainly focused on to solve a particular problem using appropriate algorithm within very short time, as a result coding standard was not followed. You can find some very dirty coding as well. 

b) Please don't submit the solution without understanding. 

I will try to write explanation of some complex solutions if I able to manage time at my personal site: http://www.monirthought.com
